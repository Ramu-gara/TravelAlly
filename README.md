# Project Overview
Travel Ally is an AI-powered travel assistant that generates personalized trip itineraries based on user preferences without requiring complex prompts. Unlike traditional travel planners, it dynamically adjusts schedules based on weather, budget, and real-time location status, ensuring a smooth and efficient travel experience.

# Problem Statement
Trip planning is often time-consuming and inconvenient, requiring multiple tools to check flights, hotels, local attractions, and real-time conditions. Existing travel planners provide static itineraries that do not account for last-minute changes like closures, delays, or budget constraints.

# Key Features

Users select trip preferences via checkboxes instead of writing detailed prompts.
AI generates a structured, optimized itinerary instantly.
Real-Time Itinerary Adjustments

Checks location status (open/closed) before adding to the plan.
Updates schedules based on weather conditions and traffic data.
Budget-Conscious Planning

Suggests cost-effective alternatives if the user exceeds their budget.
Tracks real-time hotel and flight price changes.
Local and Hidden Gem Recommendations

Goes beyond standard tourist attractions by integrating local insights from data sources.
Visa and Travel Requirement Checker

Provides basic visa and travel restriction information based on nationality.

# Tech Stack and Implementation
