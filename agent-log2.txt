Honolulu is a wonderful travel destination that can be visited year-round thanks to its warm and pleasant weather. However, it's worth noting that there is a hurricane season from June to November. The city offers a mix of beautiful beaches, historical sites, and cultural experiences. Some of the must-visit places include Waikiki Beach, Pearl Harbor National Memorial, and Diamond Head State Monument. In terms of costs, Honolulu can be quite expensive with mid to high-end prices for restaurants, accommodation, and activities, but budget options are also available. For safety, the city is generally safe but, as with any city, tourists should be cautious especially at night and in less crowded areas.

## Final Answer: 
In Honolulu, there are several options for local transportation:

1. TheBus: Honolulu's public transit system is known as TheBus. It offers extensive coverage of the island, including popular tourist destinations like Waikiki Beach, Pearl Harbor National Memorial, and Diamond Head State Monument. TheBus operates 24/7 on most routes, and a 4-day pass costs $35.

2. Car Rental: For more flexibility, consider renting a car. This gives you the freedom to explore the island at your own pace. Keep in mind that parking can be expensive in the downtown area and near major attractions. Companies like Enterprise, Hertz, and Budget have outlets in Honolulu.

3. Biki: If you prefer a more active form of transportation, you can rent a Biki bike. There are over 100 Biki stops throughout Honolulu, and it's a great way to explore the city while getting some exercise. A 5-day pass costs $25.

4. Taxis and Ride-Sharing: If you prefer a more direct mode of transportation, taxis and ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft are also available in Honolulu. However, these can be more expensive, especially during peak hours.

Remember, no matter which transportation option you choose, always follow local traffic laws and safety guidelines. Enjoy your trip!

## Final Answer: 
Honolulu, the vibrant epicenter of Hawaii, offers a mix of urban hustle and laid-back island vibes. Here are insider tips for your visit:

1. **Local Customs:** Aloha spirit is integral to Hawaiian culture. It's not just a greeting, but a way of life, embodying respect, love, and harmony. When meeting locals, a warm "Aloha" with a smile goes a long way. Hawaiians also value their land or 'aina', so ensure you respect the environment.
   
2. **Etiquette:** Do not refuse when offered a Lei (flower garland). It's considered disrespectful. Remove it discretely if needed. Also, it's considered rude to turn your back to the ocean, showing a lack of respect to the sea gods according to local beliefs.

3. **Food Recommendations:** Don't miss out on traditional Hawaiian dishes like Poke (raw fish salad), Lau Lau (pork wrapped in taro leaf), and Haupia (coconut milk dessert). Visit Ono Hawaiian Foods for an authentic local dining experience.

4. **Off-The-Beaten-Path Experiences:** For a unique experience, visit the Byodo-In Temple, a replica of a Japanese temple nestled in the lush greenery of the Valley of the Temples. Take a drive to the North Shore for stunning views and sea turtle spotting. 

5. **Weather-Specific Tips:** With the observed weather, it's perfect to explore outdoor attractions. However, carry a light rain jacket for the patchy rain. 

Remember, the key to a great trip to Honolulu is to embrace the local culture, respect the customs, and indulge in the authentic food while exploring beyond the popular tourist spots. Enjoy your trip! Aloha!
